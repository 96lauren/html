     <h2>The michaelson's family</h2>
<p>
  We've all heard the legends, the first vampires. Their eternal vow. How they roamed the Earth a thousand years, saw empires rise and fall.<br> To most, they were monsters, but to a few, they were something more. If you look closely, you'll find traces of them through history. They've got a bit of a reputation. After a thousand years, things can get complicated.<br> Eventually, they were drawn back to a place they once called home, somewhat reluctantly. But they just couldn't resist New Orleans where the good times roll and the heads do too. It wasn't easy, but some things are worth fighting for.<br> <br>Some things you can't give up on, even when all hope is lost. Even when it seems like it's over; it's never over. Some things can't be broken. But what happens when the thing you love most is overtaken by darkness? How can you fight your enemies, while also fighting yourself? Every family has a legacy, and this is mine. I intend to fight for "Always and Forever", even if it destroys me.[1]   ‚Äù
